/// Trivial example of using libMultiMarkdown within a Swift
/// project.  Needs a lot of work to be functional.


// libMultiMarkdown is built as shared library -- needs to be static
// libMultiMarkdown is named liblibMultiMarkdown -- need to fix

// Needs the functionality from main.c in order to become viable
// replacement for the c build.

// But as a proof of concept, it works.

import libMultiMarkdown

// token_pool_init()

let text = "This is a *test* string"
let output = d_string_new("")
let format = Int16(FORMAT_HTML.rawValue)

let e = mmd_engine_create_with_string(text, 0)

mmd_engine_parse_string(e)
mmd_engine_export_token_tree(output, e, format)

// token_pool_drain()

let str = String(cString: output!.pointee.str!)

print(str)

// token_pool_free()
